# In this script, processing steps are applied to the tree features 
# generated using in-situ NEON woody vegetation structure data: 
# 
# 1. Identical multi-bole entries are identified and excluded 
# from subsequent analysis to remove duplicated points or polygons present 
# in the raw data set. 
# 
# 2. An area threshold is then applied to remove any small trees area values 
# less than the area of four hyperspectral pixels. This threshold 
# was selected with the coarser resolution of the hyperspectral and LiDAR data 
# products in mind. By preserving the trees with larger crowns, it is believed 
# that purer spectra will be extracted for them for the training data sets, 
# as opposed to extracting mixed pixels which signal from smaller plants and 
# background materials or neighboring vegetation. 
# 
# 3. “Engulfed” polygons, those which are shorter and completely within the 
# boundaries of other polygons, are also present in the initial crown polygons.
# Since they likely cannot be observed from the airborne perspective, 
# “engulfed” polygons were removed from subsequent analysis. Remaining 
# polygons were checked for overlap with neighboring polygons. For each 
# overlapping pair of polygons, shorter polygons were clipped by taller 
# ones. If the remaining clipped area was smaller than the aforementioned area 
# threshold, it was deleted. 
#
# At this point, this workflow has generated a collection of polygons that 
# will theoretically intersect with independent pixels in the airborne remote 
# sensing data.


# Remove multi-bole entries -----------------------------------------------

# Identify multi-bole entries: sometimes, there are multiple entries with 
# identical coordinates, height, and crown diameter (but their individualID's 
# are different, with "A", "B", etc. appended on the end of the last five 
# numbers.) In this step, the individualID values are assessed to find 
# multi-bole sets. If the coordinates, height, and crown diameters are 
# identical, then the entry with a letter appended on the end is deleted 
# from the analysis. This prevents duplicate polygons being used to extract 
# spectra. 

# List all individual ID strings

# are True, but stem entries (without letters) are False
